Age Rating Classification for Film Content

A Machine Learning Framework using IMDb Severity Metadata and YouTube Sentiment Signals


📌 Overview

This project builds an automated, scalable age–appropriateness prediction system for movies by combining structured severity annotations from the IMDb Parental Guide dataset with sentiment-derived severity signals from YouTube movie trailer comments.
Instead of relying on manual age-rating systems such as MPAA/BBFC, this project uses data-driven machine learning approaches to predict:
Severity codes for:
Sex & Nudity
Violence & Gore
Profanity
Drugs/Alcohol
Intense/Frightening Scenes
Final MPAA Rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17)
The framework is designed to be interpretable, reproducible, and cross-domain, aligning structured IMDb annotations with real-world audience sentiment.

📂 Datasets
1. IMDb Parental Guide Dataset (Training)
Contains ~49k movies with human-annotated severity levels across 5 categories.
Severity labels (None, Mild, Moderate, Severe) are encoded into 0–3.
Includes metadata such as runtime, votes, ratings, and certification.
2. YouTube Trailer Dataset (Testing)
Contains movie trailer URLs. Additional fields generated through scraping & analysis:
Top-20 user comments using yt-dlp
Video metadata (views, likes, publish date)
Sentiment polarity scores
Keyword-based content mentions (violence, profanity, drugs, etc.)
Sentiment distributions are automatically mapped to IMDb-like severity codes (0–3).

⚙️ Methodology
Step 1 — IMDb Data Preprocessing

Encode severity labels
Standardize MPAA ratings (G → NC-17)
Handle missing values
Log-transform skewed features (e.g., numVotes)
Min–Max scaling
Apply SMOTE to address class imbalance

Step 2 — YouTube Comment Extraction & Sentiment Severity

Extract comments + metadata
Clean & preprocess text
Apply sentiment analysis
Convert aggregated sentiment → severity levels
Align test dataset with IMDb schema

Step 3 — Model Training

A total of 12 machine learning models were trained:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
KNN
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
LightGBM
CatBoost
Bagging
Voting Classifier
AdaBoost
MLP Neural Network
Hyperparameter tuning used GridSearchCV + 5-fold cross-validation.

Step 4 — Evaluation Metrics

Performance was measured using:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall
Weighted & Macro F1
ROC–AUC Curves
Precision–Recall Curves
KS Statistic
Lift Analysis


🏆 Results
Best-performing model:
⭐ Random Forest
Accuracy: 0.7759
Weighted F1: 0.7093
Other strong models: CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, Bagging, Voting Classifier.
Weak models: AdaBoost, MLP (due to imbalance and noisy labels).


📊 Visual Insights

The project includes rich EDA and diagnostic plots:
Severity distribution
Sentiment polarity distribution
Word clouds & keyword frequencies
ROC–AUC curves
Precision–Recall curves
KS curves
Lift curves
These help understand severity co-occurrence, user sentiment patterns, and classifier separability.

📈 Key Insights

Violence & Intense scenes show the highest correlation and have the strongest impact on MPAA prediction.
LightGBM shows the best class separability (highest KS).
Voting Classifier achieves near-perfect AUC in mid/high severity classes.
IMDb severity labels transfer well to YouTube sentiment-derived severity, validating cross-domain alignment.


🚧 Challenges

Sparse high-severity categories (NC-17)
Sarcasm or vague YouTube comments lowering sentiment accuracy
Inconsistent content between trailers and full movies
Noise introduced in keyword-based comment mapping


🔮 Future Work

Planned extensions include:
Transformer-based sentiment modeling (sarcasm, nuance, multi-label)
Vision models (ViT/CNN/LSTM) for scene-level severity estimation
Cross-regional certification (CBFC, OFLC, CHVRS)
Explainability (SHAP/LIME) for feature and phrase importance
Enhanced multi-label severity extraction from comments

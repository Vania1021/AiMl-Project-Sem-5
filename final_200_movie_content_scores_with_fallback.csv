There are a lot of good X-Men films, but this one has a sort of magic to it that the others don't have.

I always felt that was quite a main flaw in a lot of X-Men films, trying to juggle multiple characters and yet most of the X-Men films tend to focus on Logan. That doesn't mean I don't like Wolverine as a character, but the X-Men is a team and I felt while there was a team Logan was always front and centre and kind of overshadowed everyone else. This film was the first that didn't have to rely on Wolverine's popularity and the writers decided to give the stage to a bunch of lesser known characters instead and it felt so refreshing to me.

She was surrounded by “paper towns” and “paper people”, all of whom she saw as fake. They lived their lives as if to chase perfection and she even did that for awhile. She was the beloved popular girl with a boyfriend and a huge social stratosphere. But she realized that that stuff, those people, were her future. She left the next morning after the night with Quentin, but she left bread crumbs. They’re viewed as pieces to see her whereabouts, to where she’s gone. But she doesn’t want to go back, she wants to say that she was there in that paper town. The breadcrumbs were the memories, and the fact is she did grow up there. But she doesn’t want to stay, she wants to find herself, she wants to see what can happen if you break free from your perfectly set future and find what could actually happen.

In the movie, she feels very offended by it just like in the book but except she tries to get Wesley to help her not look like one. In the Book she begins to have family and ex-boyfriend issues and then uses him as an escape from her real problems by having sex with him, so they became enemies-with benefits.

In the books  Bianca curses Ode, especially at Wesley.

Apparently others that saw this film thought the pace was too slow, but I disagree. To me, the story was one of hidden desires, slowly brought to the surface until everything boils over. The main character had a yearning for year's passed, and even though his subsequent decisions are incredibly selfish, they are admittedly understandable. Responsibilities and emotional ties can grow into prisons over time, and every so often, a way out presents itself. The heart wrenching decision is whether to put yourself aside, focus on what you're supposed to do, and keep moving; or finally give in to the things hidden deep within ourselves, even though they can hurt those we love the most. The entire film is a wonderful visualization of this slow process. \n\nSpoiler Alert.\n\nThe last scene in which Lauren's wounds are scarred over seems to either represent forgiveness over time, or the act we put on to keep up appearances, putting on fake smiles for the cameras (society). "", ""Such an underrated film!

He actually grooms Mia and starts to groom Tyler as you can see in subtle ways (tickling, telling Tyler she can go the bathroom when he's there etc). Second, Connor knows that the audition that Mia is planning on attending is for exotic dancing but doesn't let on simply because he is there to use and dissapear. He's looking for sensation in his life which is bland and boring. The emotions of this family are just a game to him. Thirdly, Mia isn't meant to be an excellent dancer. That's part of the social realism of this film. She doesn't have access to other dancers to dance with or much training or even private empty areas to dance. She is limited and therefore her dancing is. This is a fact that is meant to demonstrate how working class people seek escape thru various methods (dance for Mia) but rarely do they come to much because of the limitations imposed by poverty itself. Overall this film is about how the pervading structures of inequality that divide Mia and Connors lives create an environment that encourages one group (Connor) exploiting another (Mia).

Ben stiller as the protagonist, was suffered from giving away his crews' money to the boss for investment. In this movie, he showed the responsibility and consequences he has to suffer through out the whole plot. He took up the courage and planned out a heist,  a lot of funny things happened between these ordinary men and their lack of experience during a heist. It was this kind of contrast between normal people and a well planned, poorly executed, and full surprises that made this movie funny. However, this movie is tragic in a way, that in the end of the movie, the protagonist really stepped up for the ultimate sacrifice, and used every possible way and connection he can, to make things right. The main focus of this movie was always ben stiller's internal struggle and his suffer from ruining his crews' retirement life. The burdens on him were presented from the conversation and his actions. In the end when everyone finds what was really the most valuable thing, his decision and self-realization really pushed this movie from a comedy to a meaningful film.\nBTW...\nEvery character from this movie is vivid, and it feels like they came straight out from life, except for some parts. their internal conflicts, each individual's struggles were presented well too.""]",youtube_api,

Man that one scene left such an impact."", ""HEAR ME OUT :D :D I've been studying Geisha & Maiko for 2 and a half years now!! I think people are getting confused between 'Geisha' and 'Oiran'... I will define the two words!:D\nGeisha definition: Geisha are women trained in traditional arts like dancing, music (shamisen, taito drum, singing, flute, etc), and tea ceremony! They preform at kabuki (traditional Japanese theatres, where people dance and put on plays), local festivals, and private parties (which are expensive). At the private parties geisha entertain their guests by dancing, singing, serving sake, and playing games (like Rock Paper Scissors, and Konpira Funefune)-- There is not prostitution at the private parties, in fact a lot of a lot of guests at the parties are female, and there are kids at the parties too! It's a great thing to do with you family! :D \nOiran definition: Oiran and Tayū were high ranking prostitutes, and are disappeared after the anti-prostitution laws in 1958. They looked VERY similar to geisha, and were trained in traditional as well.\nBOTTOM LINE. Geisha WERE NOT allowed to get together with they're clients. It wasn't, and still isn't, part of a geisha's job to be a prostitute. Geisha weren't/aren't prostitutes. Oiran were prostitutes. \nI think all the confusion came about when the first Americans went over to Japan during WW2. Because there were these oiran and bathhouse geisha (bathhouse geisha were girls that worked at 'onsen' hot springs, they were prostitutes. They weren't real geisha.), that called themselves 'Geee-sha girls', and they were prostitutes. The Americans thought that the 'Geee-sha girls' were real geisha, so from that day on Westerners though real Geisha were Oiran prostitutes...\nI think this movie is very stupid, and really a let down (because I was excited when I heard about it), because it's so far from the truth. And not just the movie, the book as well... Why didn't the author, Arthur Golden, just make the book about Oiran?? \n\nIF YOU WANT TO READ A BOOK ABOUT A REAL GEISHA, I KNOW ONE!! There's a book written by a REAL retired geisha!! The famous geisha Golden interviewed for research!!The book is called,Geisha: A Life By Mineko Iwasaki\n\nAlso, Maiko/Geisha DID NOT sell their virginity to the highest bidder!!!! Oiran DID though.Also, the dancing in the movie sucks XD But the costumes are good :))"", ""They did her character age progression SO well."", ""The Japanese word geisha literally means “art person/artist\"".

From the beginning, the movie audience is tricked to believe that Amanda is way smarter and more clever than sweet less abrasive Lily but Lily was actually smarter than her friend, Amanda. She used her friend's weakness of being unemotional and psychopathic to get what she wanted in the very end. In fact, the last line showed me that sometimes mental disorders can sometimes maybe serve as a \""gateway\"" to other mental disorders. Lily started off as narcissistic and ended up becoming unemotional and sociopathic/psychopathic or was Lily all these things all along but never diagnosed..hmmm..makes you wonder. The last line showed that she couldnt care less about how her friend was doing and she was outsmarting Amanda all along. Growing up, we are always taught that someone having too much emotion is weak but in actuality Lily's undiagnosed narcissicism and \""emotional oversensitivity\"" prevailed over someone who lacked emotion. People always think that those without emotions are stronger than others because they dont make rash decisions based on emotions but the movie shows that being unemotional can prove itself to be detrimental and consequential as well #2.) We as a watcher was supposed to think that the stepdad and drug dealer were bad guys because of their \""external packaging\""...the obvious jerk \""d-bag\"" stepdad and obvious sexual deviant drug dealer selling to minors and there was definitely some underlining sexual tension there intended for us as a viewer to assume that the stepdad could have been attempting inappropriate physical/sexual behavior towards the step daughter. However, but the point in which I began to change my thoughts about the stepdad was the scene in which he said that Lily treat people like they \""work for her...like a maid or housekeeper\"" and then I began to see some truth in his statements. The drug dealer was all bark and no bite which was evident at the house party when he got punched and didnt even fight back but also the bath scene when he discovered his head injury. Both characters appeared to be tough on the outside in their \""external packaging\"". The fact that Lily even contemplated about drugging her friend just to frame her for the killing was enough for me to realize even more so what this movie is all about. It doesnt matter to me that Lily tried to stop her friend from finishing the drink. Lily was already involved in trying to blackmail the drug dealer. The fact that she even had the thought to frame her friend as well was enough the validate the earlier statements made by her stepdad. Things that externally appear sweet and innocent are sometimes more dangerous than the obvious jerk/dbag/drug dealer that wrapped up in the wrong \""external package\"".  Both girls suffered from a slightly different mental disorders which in a weird way caused them to use or expose the other's weakness throughout the movie. Lily was presented to us as this \""pristine perfect beautiful girl\"" who is harmless but in actuality she was the most dangerous character in the movie. Things that come in pretty and flawless external packages can actually do more harm than something thats obviously is unpolished and flawed and abrasive like Amanda. For example, when we were kids and went \""trick or treating\"" we were taught to always throw away the candy that had bad packaging because there is risk that what was inside the packaging was harmful. What we werent necessarily taught is that candy with untampered undamaged external packaging could still conceal something harmful on the inside. In fact, kids would quickly eat the candy that \""appeared\"" to be flawless and unharmful from the outside packaging. However, if someone wanted to really do harm they would find a way to tamper whats inside the packages without causing harm to the packaging itself, right? Lily was a narcissistic but not diagnosed. She wanted to always have her way and her narcissicism made her do whatever it took to get her way...even if that meant framing her unemotional psychopathic friend to kill her jerkish but not evil stepdad. Amanda's also suffered from narcisscism because she sometimes thought she was three steps ahead of everyone. Amanda walked around with ego and thought she was so clever and more observant than others but her egotism/ narcissicism caused her not to realize that the sweet innocent seemingly naive Lily was six steps ahead of everyone including Amanda herself. To me, this movie causes us to think who could prevail more in life..a  Sociopath like Lily or Psychopath like Amanda. One is born with it and the other learns the behavior from the environment as means of survival."", ""Anya Taylor joy is beautifully hypnotic.
